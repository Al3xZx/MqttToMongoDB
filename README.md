# MqttToMongoDB Dockerized Application

This repository contains a Dockerized Java application that connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a specified topic,
and stores the received messages in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker
from [the official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Usage

To test the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Al3xZx/MqttToMongoDB.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `docker` directory:

    ```bash
    cd MqttToMongoDB/docker
    ```

3. Run the application using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

   This command will build and start the Docker containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. To send data to the MQTT topic, you can use an MQTT client. One such client is "MQTTX" (https://mqttx.app/) or "MQTT
   Explorer" (https://mqtt-explorer.com/). Connect to the MQTT broker with the following details:

    - **Broker Address:** localhost
    - **Port:** 1883
    - **Username:** mqttuser
    - **Password:** mqttpsw
    - **Topic:** topic/test

   Publish messages to this topic to observe the application's behavior.

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the Docker containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Feel free to explore the application's source code and configurations for further customization.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
